DEFINITION (Applications and atoms).  An application is a sequence of
atoms.  An atom is either a function symbol or a pointer to an
application.

DEFINITION (Graph).  The graph is a collection C of applications, of
which exactly one (the "spine application") is not pointed-to by any
pointer in any application in C.

DEFINITION (Unique pointer).  A unique pointer points to an
application that is not pointed-to by any other pointer in the graph.
Many applications may contain a pointer to an application containing a
unique pointer.

COROLLARY. A unique pointer appearing in the spine application points
to an application that is not reachable from any other pointer in the
graph.

DEFINITION (Dashed and undashed pointers).  A pointer is either dashed
or undashed.

INVARIANT. Every dashed pointer is a unique pointer.
